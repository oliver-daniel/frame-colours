# frame-colours
Generates barcode-like images from average colours of every second of a YouTube video.


Requires <a href="https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl">youtube-dl</a>, and you may have to configure App.java:31 to match its position on your machine. Additionally, I have no idea how to use dependencies, so don't forget to add the contents of lib to your classpath.

Cheers!
